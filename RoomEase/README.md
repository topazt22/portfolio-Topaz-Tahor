# 🏠 RoomEase – Roommate Matching App  

## 📌 Problem  
Finding a suitable roommate is often stressful and inefficient.  
Existing platforms focus mainly on listings, but not on **compatibility** and user experience.  

## 🔄 Process  
- Defined the core user problem through brainstorming  
- Designed two main UI screens to demonstrate the concept  
- Built user flow around:  
  1. Creating a roommate profile  
  2. Viewing apartment & roommate details in a single interface  

## 🎯 Result  
- Two prototype screens showcasing the app’s main concept  
- Clear flow to highlight both the individual roommate profile and shared apartment profile  

## 💡 Value  
Even with limited visuals, RoomEase demonstrates:  
- My ability to translate a real-life need into a digital product concept  
- Designing a simple MVP with measurable KPIs (retention, engagement, conversion)  
- Laying the foundation for a scalable product
