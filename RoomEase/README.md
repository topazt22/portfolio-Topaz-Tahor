# 🏠 RoomEase – Roommate Matching App  

## 📌 Problem  
Finding a compatible roommate is often stressful, inefficient, and based on incomplete information.  
Most existing platforms focus on apartment listings rather than **compatibility and lifestyle fit** between people.  

## 🔄 Process  
- Defined the key user pain: lack of personalized roommate matching  
- Designed two core UI screens to illustrate the product’s value proposition:  
  1. **Roommate Profile View** – displaying personal traits, lifestyle, and compatibility score  
  2. **Match Finder View** – enabling users to filter preferences and discover top matches  
- Framed the concept around measurable KPIs: user retention, active daily users, successful matches  

## 🎯 Result  
- Two prototype screens showcasing the **minimum viable product (MVP)** concept  
- A clear product story that emphasizes **compatibility-first roommate search**  
- Demonstrated the potential to scale into a fully featured platform with enhanced filtering, chat, and verification  

## 💡 Value  
This project highlights my ability to:  
- Translate a real-life need into a **digital product concept**  
- Build and present an MVP prototype that demonstrates the **core value of the solution**  
- Focus on **user experience and product KPIs** to ensure measurable success
